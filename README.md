## UX

LadyBike is a cycling booking platform only for women. It provides three biking classes, and articles focused on a healthy lifestyle and cycling tips. It is designed in light and dark-coloured style, using fuchsia and dark light grey colours. The user is given plenty of choices on how to get to the booking form from the home page - via the navbar and a call to action button.

Users can log in with their credentials to make a booking and like the articles. 

## Purpose

The app is designed as a booking application that encourages the users to make a booking.

### Canban board and issues

![Screenshot of the canban board](README_docs/Kanbar_board/kanban.png)

Github issues were used to create the User stories and group them according to MoSCoW prioritization technique. Link to the project with live issues can be found [here](https://github.com/van-essa/ladybike/projects/1). The issues are currently in two categories - done or for the next release.
